📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease using various health indicators.
It aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making through the power of Machine Learning.

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Total Records: 303

Target Variable: num (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Gender vs Heart Disease (Grouped Bar Chart)

Chest Pain Type vs Heart Disease

Age Distribution (Histogram, Boxplot)

Correlation Heatmap

Heart Rate (thalach) vs Heart Disease (Boxplot)

Resting BP (trestbps) vs Heart Disease

ST Depression (oldpeak) vs Target (Violin Plot)

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled categorical columns via One-Hot Encoding

Converted binary categorical variables to integers

Removed non-numeric columns

Split data into train/test sets

🤖 Modeling

RandomForestClassifier

n_estimators = 100, random_state = 42

Trained and evaluated using:

accuracy_score

classification_report

confusion_matrix

ROC-AUC Score
